Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions
By default in statements in Javascript are executed from top to bottom
If the processing logic require so the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two ways
    -Conditional execution: A block of one or more statements will be executed is a certain condition
    is true
    -Repetitive execution: A block or one or more statements will be repetitively executed
    as long as a certain condition is true

To implement a candition one of this ways can be used
    -if
    -if else
    -if else if else
    -switch
    -ternary operators

if
    if (condition) {
        //code that will be executed if the condition is true
    }

if else
    if (condition){
        //code that will be executed if the condition is true
    } else {
        //code that will be executed if the condition is false
    }

if else if else
    if (condition){
        //code that will be executed if the condition is true
    } else if (condition) {
        //code that will be executed if the second condition is true
    }

switch
    switch(caseValue){
        case 1:
            //code
            break
        case 2:
            //code
            break
        default:
            //code
            break
    }

ternary operators
    let isRainingMen = true
    isRainingMen
        ? console.log("Halleluja")
        : console.log("No, there are not raining men")
